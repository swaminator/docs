[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/aws-amplify/docs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/aws-amplify/docs)

This is the main documentation repository for the Amplify Framework. We welcome [feedback](https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/issues/new) and contributions. [Get Started >>](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs)

## V2 Docs (Preview)

We just launched a preview of our new docs site. Check it out at **https://docs.amplify.aws** ðŸš€


## Contributing

The documentation is tested for spelling errors in CircleCI and against a custom dictionary [.spelling](https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/master/.spelling). Add the words here e.g. service names etc. that should be bypassed by the checker. The spelling is checked via the `npm test` command during the build. You can see failing builds / errors by clicking on the build badge above. There is also a grammar check that should be run locally via `npm run grammar`.

- NPM or Yarn: check with `npm --version` or `yarn --version`
